# Raspberry Cam

The aim of this project is to give instructions how to build up your own [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org/) web camera. It is assumed that you have a computer, a Raspberry Pi with camera, an SD card and a connection to internet available. Also, you should have a [Google Cloud Platform](https://cloud.google.com/) account.



Roughly the steps are the following (below we will go through each step in more detail):

1. Download the operating system Raspbian to the SD card.
2. Connect your computer to Raspberry Pi via SSH and enable the camera.
3. Create a new project to your Google Cloud account.
4. Resources and adding them to your GC bucket.


### Now, let's get started!

1. Download Raspbian to your computer from [downloads section](https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/) of Raspberry Pi main page. Insert the SD card to your computer and use the [Pi Filler](http://ivanx.com/raspberrypi/) program to set up Raspbian to the SD card. Insert the SD card to the Raspberry Pi.

2. Connect your computer with Raspberry Pi through SSH connection. This is done by giving a command
```
ssh pi@raspberrypi.local
```
in the terminal/bash. It may well be that at the first time the SSH can not find your Raspberry Pi by the name raspberrypi.local. If this is the case, you'll have to find RP's IP address by giving the command
```
ping raspberrypi.local
```
Now you should see RP's IP address, so typing
```
ssh pi@<IP>
```
will get you an access to RP - the default password is just *raspberry*. By command
```
sudo raspi-config
```
you will get the Raspberry Pi Software Configuration Tool. There you should
 1. change the default password to your own,
 2. enable the camera.



3. Create a new project in your Google Cloud account.
4. Clone this repository to your computer. Modify the install.sh by adding the GCP project name and your local directory name to it. Run install.sh on your terminal OR follow the instructions in 4* below.

4*. Alternatively you can run the commands of install.sh one by one as follows.

4*.a. First, we create a bucket to your GCP project by:
```
gsutil mb -l eu -p <project name> <bucket name>
```
NOTE: Your bucket name should be of the following form: gs://<project name>-bucket. For instance, if your project name is *supercool-raspberry-pi-webcam*, then replace bucket name by *gs://supercool-raspberry-pi-webcam-bucket*.

4*.b. The next command enables your project to use source repository (this should not cost anything).

```
gcloud services enable sourcerepo.googleapis.com
```

4*.c. Create a new source repository for the files by:
```
gcloud source repos create <raspberry-webcam-repo>
```
You can name the repository as you wish.

4*.d. Authenticate git with gcloud by the command (make sure you are in your local directory for Raspberry):

```
git config credential.'https://source.developers.google.com'.helper gcloud.sh
```
4*.e. The following makes initial commit for the repo.

```
git add .
git commit -m "initial commit"
```
4*.f. Make your source repository to be the remote (named google).

```
git remote add google https://source.developers.google.com/p/raspberry-r-test/r/raspberry-webcam-repo
```

4*.g. Push your files to the source repository's master branch.
```
git push google master
```

4*.h. Create a service account and a secret key to it.

```
gcloud iam service-accounts create raspberry-pi-service-account --display-name "Raspberry Service Account"
```
```
gcloud iam service-accounts keys create key.json --iam-account=raspberry-pi-service-account
```

4*.i. Copy the secret key to your Raspberry Pi and activate the service account.

```
scp key.json pi@raspberrypi.local:.
ssh pi@raspberrypi.local gcloud auth activate-service-account --key-file=key.json

```
